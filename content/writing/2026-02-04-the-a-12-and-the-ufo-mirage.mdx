The A-12 OXCART flew even higher and faster than the U-2. For civilians and airline pilots in the 1960s, its shock diamonds and contrails looked like physics breaking in real time.

Like the U-2, the plane was classified. Controllers and investigators had to explain sightings without naming the aircraft — weather balloons again became the default cover. The pattern repeated: a technology lag turned invisible programs into public mysteries.

The result was a second wave of UFO reports that simply mapped to Blackbird test flights. The sky hadn’t changed, but the disclosures were still years behind the capabilities overhead. That gap is the mirage. It turns national security secrets into folklore until the paperwork finally catches up.
