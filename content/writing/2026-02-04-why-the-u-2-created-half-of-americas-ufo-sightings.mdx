In the 1950s a classified glider‑like spy plane — the U‑2 — flew above 70,000 feet, a part of the sky the public did not believe existed. Sunlight still hit its wings after dusk, so civilians and pilots saw silent, glowing objects hanging over the horizon.

### The Technology Lag
The U‑2 exposed a structural delay between breakthrough and disclosure: capabilities arrived years before officials could admit they existed. That “technology lag” guaranteed misidentification.

### The surge of sightings
Project BLUE BOOK logs in the late 1950s filled with reports of bright objects above commercial and fighter ceilings. Air-traffic controllers tracked lights their radars could not explain. Decades later, a CIA history conceded that more than half of those sightings were U‑2 (and later OXCART) flights misread by observers.

### Secrecy as camouflage
Because the program was classified, controllers were told to deflect with weather balloons or silence. The growing stigma around “UFO people” became a shield: ridicule protected the very aircraft causing the mystery.

### The reveal
When a U‑2 was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960, the altitude gap closed overnight. The sky hadn’t changed; the paperwork had. The episode shows how undisclosed systems routinely spill into public view as the unexplained — a pattern that would repeat with the SR‑71, F‑117, and B‑2.
