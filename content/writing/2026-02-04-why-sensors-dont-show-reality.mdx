title: "Why Sensors Don’t Show Reality"
summary: "Sensing stacks are negotiated pictures of the world, not neutral captures. Treating them as truth flattens the very politics they are meant to inform."

Every sensor is a story about what matters. A detector encodes a worldview: which signals count, how often they are checked, and who gets to see them. The output feels objective because it arrives as numbers, yet those numbers are produced by a chain of choices—physics, firmware, business models, and institutional defaults—that rarely make it into the PDF report.

The danger is mistaking sensor output for ground truth. When a city deploys air-quality monitors on affluent streets and calls the resulting map “objective,” it hides the fact that whole neighborhoods were never measured. When a shipping firm optimizes cameras for daylight and declares its safety data “complete,” it ignores the night shift. The measurements are real; the claims we make with them often are not.

Instead of chasing perfect sensors, we should ask better questions about what they are allowed to notice. Who gets to define the baseline? How often are the thresholds revisited? What communities can contest the calibration? Treating sensing as civic infrastructure—rather than a neutral technical system—keeps us honest about the politics inside our data.
